Here we are going to create a new Simple Spring boot appliaction.

Here in this Project we are just creating one normal DataController. Which has only getmethod mapped with (/getdata) mapping.

For starting the spring bootapp we have to create one main class and we have to annotate with below 3 annotation.
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@Configuration
@ComponentScan

Instead of these 3 Annotation we can only use
@SpringBootApplication
This we do all the work for the above 3 Annotation.
